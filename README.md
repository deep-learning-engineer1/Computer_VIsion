Hi! This is Computer Vision model for object detection. It can detect some food: eggs, blueberry, strawberry, cucumber, tomato, banana, cookie and apple. 
I have used Tensorflow and OpenCV for a whole model. So when it runs, it has two main tasks: to detect an object, predict coordinates of box. Made in Ukraine.
