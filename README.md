Hi! This is Computer Vision model for object detection. It can detect some food: eggs, blueberry, strawberry, cucumber, tomato, banana, cookie and apple. 
I have used Tensorflow and OpenCV for a whole LeNet-5 model. So when it runs, it has two main tasks: to detect an object, predict coordinates of bounding box. Made in Ukraine. On development stage.
